# Mainmenu Screenshot Helper
This mod is for the convenience of making a standard screenshot of Minecraft main menu for Minecraft Wikis.

## What does this mod do?
- Automatically set panorama speed to 0.
- Make the "Trial available" and the "Unread news" icons always rendered.
- Make the version info at the bottom left customizable, so that you can make screenshots for the versions that even not released yet.

## How to customize the version info
- Go to the version directory where the mod is installed in.
- Create a new file named "version-text.txt" under the "config' directory.
- Write what you want to show as the version info in the file.

### Examples
If you want the shot for a release version, write as **Minecraft \<version\>**, for example:

    Minecraft 1.21.4

If you want the shot for a snapshot version (including pre-releases and release candidates), write as **Minecraft \<version\>/snapshot**, for example:

    Minecraft 1.21.4 Release Candidate 3/snapshot
